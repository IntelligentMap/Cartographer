Cartographer is the leading open-source JavaScript library for **mobile-friendly interactive maps**, based on Leaflet.
Weighing just about 37 KB of gzipped JS code, it has all the mapping [features][] most developers ever need.

Cartographer is designed with *simplicity*, *performance* and *usability* in mind.
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box,
taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while being accessible on older ones too.
It can be extended with a huge amount of [plugins][],
has a beautiful, easy to use and [well-documented][] API
and a simple, readable [source code][] that is a joy to [contribute][] to.

For more info, docs and tutorials, check out the [official website][].<br>
For **IntelligentMap downloads** (including the built master version), check out the [download page][].

We're happy to meet new contributors.
If you want to **get involved** with Cartographer development, check out the [contribution guide][contribute].
Let's make the best mapping library that will ever exist,
and push the limits of what's possible with online maps!
