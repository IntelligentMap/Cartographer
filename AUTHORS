Cartographer is a fork of Leaflet. It was forked on December 8, 2018.
Leaflet is originally created by CloudMade in 2010-2011 and Vladimir
Agafonkin in 2010-2018, and now forked Leaflet, named Cartographer, is
maintaining by Pavel Kosilo.

answer newbie questions, and generally made Cartographer that much better:
